    "----1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "Data structures are ways to organize and store data so it can be used efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Types:\n",
    "Array – fixed-size list\n",
    "Linked List – items linked in sequence\n",
    "Stack/Queue – last-in-first-out / first-in-first-out\n",
    "Tree/Graph – hierarchical or networked data\n",
    "Hash Map – key-value pairs for fast lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n",
    "Mutable data types can be changed after creation (modified in place).\n",
    "Immutable data types cannot be changed once created; any modification creates a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutable Data Types \n",
    "list\n",
    "dict\n",
    "set\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable Data Types\n",
    "int\n",
    "float\n",
    "str\n",
    "tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----3. Main differences between lists and tuples\n",
    "Lists are mutable (can be changed), tuples are immutable (can’t be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists use [], tuples use ().\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are faster and use less memory than lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----4. How dictionaries store data\n",
    "Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, they use a hash table to quickly map keys to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----5. Why use a set instead of a list\n",
    "Sets automatically remove duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets provide faster lookup (in operations) than lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n",
    "A string is an immutable sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list is a mutable sequence of items, which can be of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----7. How tuples ensure data integrity\n",
    "Tuples are immutable, so their contents can’t be changed after creation, making them useful for fixed data or as keys in dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python\n",
    "A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----9. Can lists contain different data types in Python\n",
    "Yes, Python lists can hold multiple data types (e.g., [\"hello\", 3.14, True]).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----10. Why strings are immutable in Python\n",
    "Strings are immutable to ensure security, thread safety, and to enable internal optimizations like string interning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----11. Advantages of dictionaries over lists\n",
    "Faster lookups by key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideal for mapping relationships (e.g., student names to grades).\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoids manual searching through indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----12. When to use a tuple over a list\n",
    "When you want to ensure data cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: coordinates (x, y), days of the week, dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----13. How sets handle duplicate values\n",
    "Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. Each element must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----14. How the in keyword works for lists vs dictionaries\n",
    "In lists: checks if a value exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dictionaries: checks if a key exists (not the value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----15. Can you modify elements of a tuple?\n",
    "No. Tuples are immutable, so you cannot modify, add, or remove items after creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----16. What is a nested dictionary? Example:\n",
    "A dictionary inside another dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "student = {\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Alex\",\n",
    "  \"grades\": {\n",
    "    \"math\": 90,\n",
    "    \"science\": 85\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----17. Time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
    "Average case: O(1) – constant time access using a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----18. When lists are preferred over dictionaries\n",
    "When order matters or when storing collections without key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When iterating in sequence is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----19. Why dictionaries are considered unordered (pre-3.7)\n",
    "Before Python 3.7, dictionaries didn’t preserve insertion order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now they do preserve order, but they are still accessed by key, not by position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "----20. Difference between list and dictionary in data retrieval\n",
    "List: access by index (e.g., my_list[0]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary: access by key (e.g., my_dict[\"name\"]), which is usually faster"
